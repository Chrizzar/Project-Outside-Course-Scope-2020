# qtz972: Project Outside Course Scope 2020 - Techniques to Extend our Hands further away, Interacting in VR
This is the implementation project of my Project Outside Course Scope 2020, about Techniques to Extend our Hands further away, Interacting in Virtual Reality (VR).

## This repository contains:
<ol>
  <li>An Excel ark containing the results, calculated ANOVA and Turkey HSD Test, as well as all the diagrams. <br> <b>Folder:</b> Excel Ark </li>
  <li>The program for Oculus Quest as an .apk file. <br> <b>Folder:</b> Program_Quest </li>
  <li>The program for HTC VIVE (or any PC connected VR HMD) as an .exe file. <br> <b>Folder:</b> Program_VIVE </li>
  <li>The UNITY3D (Version 2019.4.9f1) program for Quest, containing the whole implementation project. <br> <b>Folder:</b> XRInteractionToolKitV2_Quest </li>
  <li>The UNITY3D (Version 2019.4.9f1) program for HTC VIVE, containing the whole implementation project. <br> <b>Folder:</b> XRInteractionToolKitV2_VIVE </li>
</ol>

## How to interpret the program files inside UNITY3D:
Inside the Unity project, under ''Scenes'', 8 folders can be seen:

**Main Menu:**  
<ol>
  <li>Main</li>
</ol>

**Experiment combinations/orders:**  
2. O1_T1T2T3  
3. O2_T1T3T2  
4. O3_T2T1T3  
5. O4_T2T3T1  
6. O5_T3T1T2  
7. O6_T3T2T1  

**Testing scenes, that I have used to learn Unity3D:**  
8. Other

In my project, only the first 7 folders are part of the implementation project and the experiments (i.e. the 7 first folders, exclusive folder 8: ''Other'').
